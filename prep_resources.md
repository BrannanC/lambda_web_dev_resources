# Web Interview Prep Resources

- **[https://dev.to/macmacky/70-javascript-interview-questions-5gfi](https://dev.to/macmacky/70-javascript-interview-questions-5gfi)**
  It's a good idea to drill these with other students or make flashcards because these really are common interview questions.

- **The Hard Parts - Will Sentance.**
  All of them are worth watching. Available on frontendmasters.com free with your GitHub student developer pack. Prototype chain and `__proto__`, OOP in JS, basics of functional programming, Node.js, clusure, promises, all the hard interview questions are explained well in this series.

- **YDKJS - Kyle Simpson.**
  [https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
  Has lectures available on Frontend Masters as well. The main point here is learning the nuances of type conversion and `==` and `===`. Kyle Simpson is the go to resource for this, but feel free to explore elsewhere.

- **javascript.info**
  Just read through all of it at some point.

- **The Spec**
  [http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/)
  This is the actual source of truth. This isn't an interpretation of how it works, it's not an explanation of how it works, this is _how it works._ It's hard to read and not a great reference for quick questions, but dig in on the deeper questions like "what happens when a function is executed".

- **MDN**
  Of course MDN. But don't just use it for when youo forget how `.reduce()` works, there's also a bunch of tutorials and guides.

# CS and Algorithms

- **Grokking Algorithms**
  Best beginner algorithm book around.
- **[algoexpert.io](algoexpert.io)**
  It's not free but it's a great resource and you can usually find a discount code.
- **[teachyourselfcs.com](teachyourselfcs.com)**
  There's a lot of information here but take a look when you want to dig deeper on CS topics.
- **NERDfirst on YouTube**
  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCvWvqjktIq0uvM3trAHCg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCvWvqjktIq0uvM3trAHCg)
  Has a great series on graphs
- **Ben Eater**
  [https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc)
  Great for computer architecture.
- **Do the Code Challenge Grind**
  CodeSignal, LeetCode, HackerRank, Edabit, there's a ton of them. I suggest choosing one that has an interview prep track and grind it out. You'll be forced to level up your problem solving skills but also learn a ton of algorithms and data structures.

# Behavioral
- **S.T.A.R. Method**
  [S.T.A.R. Method technique for preparing interview answers](https://careercenter.lehigh.edu/node/145)
- **Projects Checklist**
