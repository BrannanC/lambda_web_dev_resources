# How To Approach the Code Challenge Grind

At some point on your road to professional software developer you will want to grind code challenges. You will develop problem solving skills and also learn common, and some not-so-common, algorithms that will make you stand out as a candidate and help you solve problems on the job as well.

### Use UPER and try to solve the problem without any hints.

- Have you seen problems that are similar to this one?
- Walk through a few examples. Sometimes stepping through some examples will give you some insight into how to solve the problem.
- Draw it out. Physically write out or draw the problem. This works especially well for Sorting, Linked List, Tree and Graph problems.
- Can you think of a "brute force" answer? Get an answer down first and optimize later. If your brute force fails for time or memory constraints then look for bottlenecks or a more efficient algorithm.

### Ok, so you're stuck

- Look for hints, not the answer. If there's a comment section available look there first. Otherwise searching for the challenges name or the type of problem it is will usually get you results.
- Sometimes there was something simple you weren't thinking about, and that's ok. Take note of what you missed and when you come across a similar problem in the future you'll be ready next time!
- But sometimes there's an algorithm you need, but didn't know about. Time to learn! Start reading about the algorithm and implement it. There's no shame in not knowing something and it's just not possible to reinvent every algorithm on the fly. Learn from the greats, step on the shoulders of giants and become a great problem solver and maybe some day you'll invent an algorithm that everyone will have to learn for _their_ coding interviews.

### Still stuck...

- It's ok. Some topics you're just not going to understand the first time around. Presumably you'll be learning for the rest of your life, so it's fine to set it aside.
- Look up an answer. I know you've been told over and over that you're cheating yourself if you look up an answer. But what we mean is don't copy the answer. If you can look up a solution and understand how it works that's a win. What is the thought process? Is this an implementation of a technique you've seen before? Or is it a technique you haven't seen before? Could you use it for other problems? Chances are the solution you found is in Java anyways, so try implementing it in Python or JS. Take note of how this solution works.
- Ask Lambda students and staff. There's a wealth of knowledge here, if there's something you want to know more about just ask around. And share the knowledge you've accumulated when others ask for help.
